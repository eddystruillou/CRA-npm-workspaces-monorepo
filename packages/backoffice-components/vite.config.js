// What that file does is it uses react plugin, and instructs Vite to use lib/main.js as an entry point,
// name the file, and library just library, and externalize react and react-dom dependencies.
// Meaning these dependencies wonâ€™t be bundled into your library, rather, they will be required to be installed by the project that uses that library.
//So the library build will be smaller.
